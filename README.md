Hello!
This is the the repo for my current portfolio, which I wrote after finishing my Full Stack Software Engineering bootcamp in 2023. 

The main layout for desktop was inspired by Brittany Chiang's [portfolio](https://brittanychiang.com/) (she is sooo cool) and it slowly evolved to have a landing page, styling to my liking, animations, functionality, mobile responsiveness etc. 

I am a minimalist at heart so I put more attention in the details rather than on big statement colours and animations. 

I hope you like it!
